              <p>Absolutely. The workshop is designed to deliver standalone value. You'll walk away with a complete, polished AI Roadmap — whether or not you choose to continue working together afterwards.</p>

              <p>You choose from three paths: self-guided implementation using your roadmap, ongoing AI coaching for monthly support, or done-with-you consulting for hands-on help. There's no pressure to commit to anything beyond the workshop itself.</p>

            <div class="faq-answer">
              <p>5-15 participants is optimal. Include a mix of decision-makers (owners, directors), department managers who understand operations, and team leads who know the daily workflows. The best results come from having diverse perspectives in the room.</p>
